Challenge #3: Job Board Filter + Search UI

Scenario:
You’ve been hired to improve the job board UI. Add the ability to filter jobs by location, remote status, and search job titles or companies.

🎯 Requirements:
1. Display job cards (same as before).
2. Add text input to search by job title or company (case-insensitive).
3. Add dropdown or radio filter:
   - All Jobs
   - Remote Only
   - Onsite Only
4. Filters must combine (e.g., “engineer” + remote only).

🛠 Tech Constraints:
- React with JavaScript (no TypeScript).
- No external component libraries.
- Use `useState` and optionally `useEffect`.
- Use provided `jobData` array as mock input.

💎 Bonus Goals:
- Show “No jobs match your search” message.
- Style input + filters to look unified.
- Add “Clear filters” button.
- Add test coverage for filtering logic (bonus).

✅ Submission:
- JobCard + any updated components.
- Filtering/search UI.
- CSS if changed.
